# Purpose

This How-To Guide provides clear, step-by-step instructions on how to
effectively use the AreaFinder app and follow GPHIN's guidelines for
geographical location of epidemiological events in GPHIN products. The
objective is to apply standardized name when reporting on events in
GPHIN products, particularly the Daily Report. The guide is designed to
ensure consistency, accuracy, and alignment with official [Government of
Canada](https://www.canada.ca/en/government/system/digital-government/digital-government-innovations/enabling-interoperability/gc-enterprise-data-reference-standards/current-past-official-names-countries-territories-geographic-areas.html)
and United Nations geolocation standards
([M49](https://unstats.un.org/unsd/methodology/m49/)), enabling the
smooth implementation of automated workflows in the GPHIN Collaboration
Hub.

# Scope

## This guide covers the following tasks:

-   How to use the AreaFinder app to select the appropriate geographical
    location (continent, region, or country) when describing events to
    GPHIN products.

-   The step-by-step process of applying the geolocation standards
    outlined in the Daily Report.

-   Guidance on ensuring that country names, regional classifications,
    and geolocation attributes adhere to the official GoC and UN M49
    standards.

# Audience

This guide is intended for GPHIN analysts and epidemiolgists.

# General Guidelines

## Country and Territory Names

-   The names of countries and territories mentioned in Daily Report
    entries will follow the spelling (including accents) as recognized
    by the [Government of
    Canada](https://www.canada.ca/en/government/system/digital-government/digital-government-innovations/enabling-interoperability/gc-enterprise-data-reference-standards/current-past-official-names-countries-territories-geographic-areas.html).

-   **Example:** Consider the following event from the Daily Report
    dated January 16, 2025:

::: center
![image](images/dr_entry_250116_3.png){width="80%"}
:::

According to the Government of Canada, the country name should be
written as 'TÃ¼rkiye':

::: center
![image](images/dr_entry_250116_3_corrected.png){width="80%"}
:::

## Event reported by Public Health Agencies (e.g., WHO, PAHO, CDC, ECDC, GPEI, among others)

-   Entries in the Daily Report will no longer be attributed to
    institutions but only to geolocalities.

-   **Example:** Consider the following event from the Daily Report
    dated January 28, 2025:

::: center
![image](images/dr_entry_250128_5.png){width="80%"}
:::

This event will be attributed to 'Americas', as it is the shared region
for the countries listed in the summary (shown below):

::: center

:::

## Attribution for Multiple Countries or Territories

-   For entries involving multiple countries or territories, the
    attribution will follow the [United Nations geoscheme
    M49](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_geoscheme)
    regions, or continents where applicable. If neither is possible, the
    entry will be attributed to **Multiregional** or **Worldwide** based
    on the following rules:

    ::: center
    ![image](images/UN_regions.png){width="90%"}
    :::

    1.  **Single Region:** If all affected locations are within one
        region, the name of that region will be assigned. **Example:**
        If the affected locations are Costa Rica and Panama, the event
        is assigned to **Central America**.

    2.  **Single Continent, Multiple Regions:** If affected locations
        span multiple regions within a single continent, the continent's
        name will be assigned. **Example:** If the affected locations
        are Czechia, Germany, and Spain, the event is assigned to
        **Europe**.

    3.  **Multiregional:** If affected locations include two or more
        regions from different continents, the event will be considered
        **Multiregional**. **Example:** If the affected locations are
        Morocco and Spain, the event is assigned to **Multiregional**.

    4.  **Worldwide:** If affected locations span all continents
        (excluding Antarctica), the event will be considered
        **Worldwide**. **Example:** If the affected locations are
        Canada, Iran, Mozambique, New Caledonia, and Switzerland, the
        event is assigned to **Worldwide**.

# Using [AreaFinder](https://areafinder.streamlit.app/) to report geolocations

-   This application was created to assist the GPHIN team in verifying
    country and territory names according to current database standards
    and to help determine the appropriate level of geolocation for
    reporting.

## Open [AreaFinder](https://areafinder.streamlit.app/):

::: center

:::

## Select affected locations by typing or scrolling through the selection menu:

::: center
![image](images/find_area_02.png){width="60%"}
:::

## Once you have completed the selection, summarize the results:

::: center
![image](images/find_area_03.png){width="60%"}
:::

## The application will display the summarized information by indicating the Affected Areas and the appropriate reporting format:
